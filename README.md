# TypeScript Sorting App

This app is based on following tutorial: https://www.udemy.com/course/typescript-the-complete-developers-guide/

## Getting started

```shell
$ npm install
$ npm start # Starts nodemon server and typescript files watcher concurrently
```

### Directories:

- "rootDir": "./src" - TypeScript uses this root directory to transpile all `.ts` files to `.js` files.
- "outDir": "./build" - This is the output directory of `.js` files.

Sorting results will be printed to the console.
